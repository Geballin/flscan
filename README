What is flscan?
---------------
FlScan is a SANE (Scanner access now's easy) frontend based on the FLTK GUI
toolkit. This is version 1.0.2

What can it do, in its present form?
------------------------------------
- Preview the image at a low resolution before scan it at an higher resolution
  (the preview image will never be greater then the preview area)
- Rotate and flip the image and adjust the horizont of the image during preview
  so the scanned image will be saved with all the tranformations you've done
- Aquire only a portion of the full image by selecting a rectangular area
- Save the image either in JPEG or in PNG format
- Save the image at many resolution in a time (Full Size = scan resolution,
  1024, 912, 700, 512, 400 pixels at maximum side), choosing among 15 different
  rescaling algorithms
- View the acquired image at the saved resolution, eventually panning with the
  scroll bars.
- Automagically support for all the options of all the image acquisition
  devices supported by SANE (FlScan will automatically grow as the SANE will
  grow) [I hope, cose I've only tested it with coolscan and pnm drivers]

How do I use it?
----------------
If you've correctly configured SANE, just run flscan, if SANE can find
an image acquisition device attacched to your computer, flscan will start
presenting on the top right side a list of grouped options for the device
found (you can change the device by selecting the "Device" option in the
"Device Selection" group).
Now you can play by selecting the options you want to inspect/modify, below
the options list will appear the controls to modify the option's value,
initialized with the current value of the option selected, when you change
the value will appear the "Set" button, clicking it will set the value.
After you've configured the device by playing with the options you can
preview the image by pressing the "Preview" button, after a while an image
will appear in the white square on the left, you can rotate and flip the
image or you can adjust its horizont by the aid of the "Pisa Tower" tool
(just place the cross air in a point, then drag towards another point, you
will see a rubber line, drop the cross and voila' the image will rotate in
a way that the rubber line is the new horizont or azimut if it was closed
to the vertical then the horizontal).
Now you can change some other scanner options (i.e. the gamma correction,
if supported) and click "Preview" until you are satisfied by the preview,
after that you can select the portion of the image you want to save by
dragging an dropping the cross air, the selected area will be surrounded
by a dashed and dotted rectangle.
Insert the name for the image to save, select the output image format
(JPEG or PNG), go to the "Application" tab (top right), choose the "Image
Converter Settings" to set the image output quality, then choose the "Output
file resolutions"  and select all the resolution you want your image will
be saved (default is "Full Size"), choose the "Zoom Filter" if you know what
you're doing (leave the default if you don't), then press the "Scan" button.
You can follow the saving process by selecting the "Conversions Status"
tab (the floppy icon, top left).
After the saving process has ended you can view the images you've saved by
selecting the "Image Viewer" tab (the photo camera icon, top left), the
rigth side of the application will change in a file selector from which
you can choose the image to view that will appear in the white square on
the left at the real size of the image selected.
If SANE can't find any device you can only view images by the "Image
Viewer" tab.
The window can be resized only by the four tools on the left of the quit
icon (the 'X' on the right), changing the size of the window will affect
the size of the preview image.
That's all.

What do I need to compile it?
-----------------------------
You need:
- FLTK 1.1.x, the Fast Light Tool Kit (http://www.fltk.org)
- SANE, at least 1.0.4 (http://www.mostang.com/sane)
- libpng, at least 1.0.11
- jpeg6
- CMake 1.6.7 (http://www.cmake.org)

How do I compile and install it?
--------------------------------
1. install or compile and install the FLTK, SANE, libpng and jpeg6 packages.
2. install or compile and install CMake.
3. cd /where/you/untarred/flscan-1.0.2; cmake && make
4. as root you can: make install
   The default installation prefix if /usr/local, to change this, edit the file
   CMakeFlags.cfg and change the setting for CMAKE_CONFIGURE_INSTALL_PREFIX

Contact me if there is a problem.

Are there any known bugs?
-------------------------
1. the "Cancel" button doesn't work
2. changing the acquisition device on the fly doesn't work properly
3. all the unknown bugs.
